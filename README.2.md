### Probabilistic Data Structure (Part 2/3)

#### Prologue
**Enough is enough!** I am a software developer NOT mathematician... What the dickens to learn inner workings of PDS? My son, things wonâ€™t always go smoothly in life, even a little drizzle can save many grains. Chances are these trivial techniques may of great help to your future career, who knows? Insteas of making this project more real, I decided to make it more funny... To be honest... Around 90% of code is written by AI, 9% of code borrows  from [here](https://github.com/redis-developer/finding-bigfoot-with-semantic-search), the last 1% is written by myself.
